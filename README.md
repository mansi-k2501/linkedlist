# Linked Lists

This repository contains C++ program on singly linked list.

**Singly Linked List:**
In a singly linked list, each node contains a data element and a pointer to the next node.
The last node points to nullptr, indicating the end of the list.
Singly linked lists are efficient for insertion and deletion at the beginning or middle but less efficient for random access because you have to traverse the list from the beginning.
